### Overview:
Cervical cancer remains a significant public health concern, particularly in regions with limited access to screening and healthcare resources. Early detection is crucial for improving treatment outcomes and survival rates. This project aims to develop a machine learning model using a dataset containing various demographic and health-related features to predict the presence of cervical cancer. The objective is to provide a tool that can aid healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and facilitating timely interventions.

### Abstract:
This study explores the application of machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest classifier, to predict cervical cancer based on patient health data. Using a dataset comprising multiple features, including age, number of sexual partners, smoking history, and history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), a predictive model was developed. Despite achieving a high accuracy of 98.81%, the model demonstrated a concerning F1 score of 0.0, indicating its inability to predict any positive cases of cervical cancer. The analysis revealed significant class imbalance, with the model favoring the majority class (negative cases) and failing to detect any positive cases. The findings highlight the challenges of applying machine learning in healthcare contexts, emphasizing the need for strategies to address class imbalance and enhance predictive performance. Future work will focus on refining the model through improved feature selection, balancing techniques, and exploring alternative algorithms.

# Conclusion:
The cervical cancer prediction model developed in this project serves as a preliminary step toward utilizing machine learning in the early detection of cervical cancer. While the model achieved a high level of accuracy, its failure to identify any actual cases of cervical cancer underscores the limitations inherent in models trained on imbalanced datasets. The high accuracy is misleading, as it masks the critical issue of missed diagnoses. To improve the model's predictive capabilities, it is essential to implement strategies to handle class imbalance, such as oversampling, undersampling, and exploring different machine learning algorithms. Further research and development are necessary to create a reliable tool for healthcare practitioners, ultimately aiming to enhance early detection efforts and improve patient outcomes in cervical cancer.
