### Overview:
Cervical cancer remains a significant public health concern, particularly in regions with limited access to screening and healthcare resources. Early detection is crucial for improving treatment outcomes and survival rates. This project aims to develop a machine learning model using a dataset containing various demographic and health-related features to predict the presence of cervical cancer. The objective is to provide a tool that can aid healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and facilitating timely interventions.
